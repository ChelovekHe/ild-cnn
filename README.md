### Environment:
This code was used on a Linux machine with Ubuntu (14.04.3 LTS) using the following setup:  
- CUDA (7.5)
- cuDNN (v3)
- python (2.7.6) with  
  * [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) (0.8)
  * [keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) (0.3.2)
  * [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) (1.10.4)
  * [argparse](https://github.com/bewest/argparse) (1.2.1)
  * [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) (0.17)
- python-opencv (2.4.10)

### Component Description:
There are three major components
- `main.py`      : the main script which parses the train parameters, loads some sample data and runs the training of the CNN.
- `helpers.py`    : a file with some helper functions for parsing the input parameters, loading sample data and calculating a number of evaluation metrics
- `cnn_model.py`  : this file implements the architecture of the proposed CNN and trains it.

### How to use:
`python main.py` : runs an experiment with the default parameters  
`python main.py -h` : shows the help message

### Output Description:
The execution outputs two csv formatted files with the performance metrics of the CNN. The first contains the performances for each training epoch while the second only for the epochs that improved the performance. The code prints the same output while running as well as a confusion matrix every time the CNN performance improves.

Peter added
add test.py file to test parameter passing

### testing
main1.py 
cnn_moidel1.py

1st trials to get the problem of input_shape corrected. Can discard it as I update main.py and cnn_model.py accordingly by taking out the activation method from LeakyRELU to RELU.

### parameter understanding

main2.py 
cnn_model2.py  
print out the CNN parameters precisely for every layer
no other changes

LeakyRELU can be done with 
model.add(LeakyReLU(params['a']))
