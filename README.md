### Environment:
The coding environmnet was used on a iMAC and PCs using the following setup:  
- OSX El Caitan version 10.11.5 with 3.06GHz IntelCoreDuo and 8MB of RAM
- PC i5 on windows 10 with 4GB/12GB of RAM
- python (2.7.11) with  
  * [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) (0.8)
  * [keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) (1.0.3)
  * [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) (1.10.4)
  * [argparse](https://github.com/bewest/argparse) (1.2.1)
  * [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) (0.17)
- python-opencv (2.4.10)

On OSX, an anaconda environment has been created and used.

# Overall Description

the repository contains mainly 3 directories
- notebooks	: mainly data preparation and utilities such as plotting results, visualisation 
- python	: files used for the training as described in next paragraph. Also predict flow support 
- pickle	: intermediate results (or glue for the various files to work)

look at the README file in the corresponding directory for more details.

### Component Description:
There are three major components
- `main.py`      : the main script which parses the train parameters, loads some sample data and runs the training of the CNN.
- `ild-helpers.py`    : a file with some helper functions for parsing the input parameters, loading sample data and calculating a number of evaluation metrics
- `cnn_model.py`  : this file implements the architecture of the proposed CNN and trains it.

### How to use:
`python main.py` : runs an experiment with the default parameters  
`python main.py -h` : shows the help message

### Output Description:
The execution outputs two csv formatted files with the performance metrics of the CNN. The first contains the performances for each training epoch while the second only for the epochs that improved the performance. The code prints the same output while running as well as a confusion matrix every time the CNN performance improves.
