## Dataset Creation for training


     TrainingDataCreation.ipynb

### Description:
Takes the .bmp files from the patches directory and creates the dataset.

Augments the data by rotating the patches 3 times by 90 degrees

Amongst the total amount of patches, uses patches only in chunks of 1000. 

Selection of patches is random based. 

Split the dataset into training (50%), validation (25%) and test set (25%).

Saves the sets into the pickle directory in 6 files
X_train, X_val, X_test for the data and y_train, y_val, y_test for labels


## Visual Check of patches
